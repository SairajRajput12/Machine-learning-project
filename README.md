Welcome to our innovative Security Surveillance System project!

## Overview

Our Security Surveillance System combines advanced face recognition and action recognition models to create a comprehensive solution for monitoring and detecting intrusions. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and MediaPipe library, our system can accurately identify faces and detect various actions such as walking, standing, running, and waving.

## Features

- **Face Recognition:** Our face recognition model achieves high accuracy in identifying faces, even under challenging conditions such as varying lighting and facial expressions.
- **Action Recognition:** Using MediaPipe and machine learning algorithms, our system can detect various actions performed by individuals, allowing for enhanced surveillance capabilities.
- **Integration with Twilio API:** In addition to facial and action recognition, our system integrates with the Twilio API to send notifications to system owners in case of intrusion detection.
- **Smart Surveillance:** Our system intelligently detects intrusions, captures images of the intruder, and sends notifications to the system owner, providing real-time monitoring and security.
